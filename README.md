# Creating a vm.vnet and rg
In this project, I deployed a Windows Server 2022 instance in Azure by first creating a custom Resource Group and Virtual Network. I configured the VM with a Standard SSD and a Public IP, ensuring all resources followed class naming conventions. Finally, I documented the configuration by capturing screenshots of the VM settings to verify the deployment.
